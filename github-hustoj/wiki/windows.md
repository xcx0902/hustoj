** people often wonder if hustoj can run in windows, the answer is yes and no.
  because hustoj rely on functions provided by linux, it can only work with linux without modification.
  BUT, linux itself can somehow run in windows in some forms.
  1. VMs, like VMWare, VirtualBox, QEMU, etc 
  2. colinux is running quite nice with windows xp
  3. there is a subsys linux come with windows 10 (update to the latest sp)
  
** all these choices has been tested and proved to be good enough for a test running of hustoj, 
  BUT not recommended for a long time running server.
